Aire Guru: Making Pollution Data Accessible, Relevant, and Compelling


Dear Dr. Bhattacharyya,

Please find attached an abstract for the article "Aire Guru: Making Pollution Data Accessible, Relevant, and Compelling",
for consideration in the Elsevier publication "Intelligent Environmental Data Analysis and Pollution Management".

This article describes a case study collecting, processing, and presenting air pollution data with the goal of improving public awareness and allowing individuals to
interpret this data in the context of their personal health.

To support this study we created a tool which proves the concept with the data provided by the Spanish city of Malaga. This tool
has been tested and the results show the success of our approach.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
