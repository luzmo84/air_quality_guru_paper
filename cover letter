Aire Guru: Making Pollution Data Accessible, Relevant, and Compelling

April 30,2017

Dear Dr. Bhattacharyya:

I am writing to submit the abstract of the article entitle "Aire Guru: Making Pollution Data Accessible, Relevant, and Compelling"
for consideration as a [Elsevier] Intelligent Environmental Data Analysis and Pollution Management. In this article
we completed a study of how to process massive air pollution information and present it to the average citizen for the
analysis, evaluation and awareness. 

To support the study, we create a tool which proves the concept with the data offered by the Malaga's council. This tool
has been tested and confirm the results expected.


Thank you for your consideration,

Sincerely,

 

Luz Morales, Master's Degree Big Data and Visual Analytics
